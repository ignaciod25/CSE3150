# CSE 3150 Exercise 5 Good Design and Structs

### This program contains unit tests for a Student class. The tests check various scenarios, ensuring the Student class functions correctly. The Student class represents a student's details, and the tests cover aspects such as retrieving information and calculating the total class score based on different inputs.

To compile the code and get student info(ID, Name, Scores), run the command:
```bash
g++ student.cpp student_main.cpp -o student_info
```
To run the executable, run the command:
```bash
./student_info
```

To compile the code and run the unit tests, run the command:
```bash
g++ unittests_student.cpp student.cpp -o unittests
```
To run the executable, run the command:
```bash
./unittests
```
