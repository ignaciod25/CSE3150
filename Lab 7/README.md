# CSE 3150 Lab 7 Cos-Distance

### This program reads in vectors of doubles in Rk where ùëò ‚â• 2 is an integer. All the vectors in the file are the same size. It computes all pairwise cosine distances for all vectors. Output pairs of vectors ‚Äì ordered by the cosine closeness of the vectors

To compile the program, run the command:
```bash
g++ double_vector.cpp main_double_vector.cpp 
```
then run the executable 
```bash
./a.out
```



To compile the program with doctest unit tests, run the command:
```bash
g++ distance_unittests.cpp double_vector.cpp -o my_tests
```
then run the executable 
```bash
./my_tests
```
