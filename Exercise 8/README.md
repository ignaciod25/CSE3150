# Exercise 8 Cos-Distance

### I've written a C++ program that reads in 2D vectors of doubles from a file. These vectors are in R2 space. Once the program reads in all the vectors, it computes the cosine distances between each pair of vectors. Then, it outputs the pairs of vectors ordered by their cosine closeness.

To run the program, run the command:

```bash
g++ main_double_vector.cpp double_vector.cpp
```

To run the doctests unit tests, run the command:

```bash
g++ double_vector_unittests.cpp double_vector.cpp -o unittests
```
