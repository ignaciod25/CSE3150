# CSE 3150 Lab 4 Generate Well Balanced List

### In this program, we are building randomly generated well balanced lists of symbols every time.

To compile the program and get a well balanced list, run the command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 gen_permutations.cpp main.cpp -o gen_per
```
then run the executable 
```bash
./gen_per
```



To compile the program with doctest unit tests, run the command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 gen_permutations.cpp unittests.cpp -o unit_tests
```
then run the executable 
```bash
./unittests
```
